# pdfnamer

# Installation
Add this folder anywhere and create a folder <code>C:/SCANS</code>. pdfnamer needs this folder to look for the pdf's. This is mainly a tool I use at work, but it can be confirgured to look for files where by changing line 34 in trimmer.py.

Make sure you look at the <code>key-example.py</code> file to see what your <code>key.py</code> file should look like.

Right now pdfnamer works with Outlook 365, and it may work with others. However, it may need extra configuring.

In the future there will be a setup option when starting up pdfnamer to change all this stuff through prompts.
